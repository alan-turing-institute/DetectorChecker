# How to generate documentation files


We use roxygen2 (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/roxygen2.html) to produce all the code documentation. All code documentation is written in the package R files above the corresponding code (e.g. every function has its documentation written directly above it). 


## Updating the man folder

We then have a folder called `man` in the repository, which is generated by opening the package in RStudio and then type:
```
devtools::check_man()
```

## Building a PDF of the documentation

To build the documentation you need to have a working latex installation.

1. Open the DetectorChecker package in R studio (click file -> open project, then select the DetectorChecker folder).

2. Update the man folder. To do this run `devtools::check_man()` in the console.

3. Make sure R's current working directory is set to the DetectorChecker folder. Then in the console run:

```system("R CMD Rd2pdf . --title=Package yourpackagename --output=./manual.pdf --force --no-clean --internals")```

This will create a pdf of the documentation. 

4. This will also create a hidden folder called `.Rd2pdf...`. You can delete this folder.
