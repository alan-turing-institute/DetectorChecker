\title{Modifying clusters to events (consisting of 1 pixel representing the cluster)
Make into a point pattern of just events rather than pixels. Using xyc_ply object.
Collapse in one point using centres for clusters, but end points for lines, type dependend:
type 5 (closest to upper edge): ymin
type 6 (closest to lower edge): ymax
type 7 (closest to right edge): xmin
type 8 (closest to left edge):  xmax
This is inspired by Perkin Elmer Detector and be replaced by other choices if desired.}
